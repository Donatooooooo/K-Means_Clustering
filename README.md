K-Means Clustering is software that does clustering of data examples starting from a relational database table. The software is made up of three applications: a server that performs clustering, saving and loading file operations and two clients to interact with the server. For ease of use, client and server use a preset IP address and port, you can change these within the code.

No complex procedures are required to run the software. However, for correct operation it is necessary that:
* An updated version of Java SDK is installed;
* MySQL service (version 5.7 or later) is installed and active;

K-Means server must be started before starting the client. Otherwise, an error message will appear, stopping the execution of the client program.
